Bowden tube coupler clips to remove any play in the coupler's retaining piece.  They can help reduce the amount of retraction needed if the retainer insert is moving during retraction and can help reduce wear on the teflon tube.  There are clips sized for different styles of couplers (more info on the different couplers on my blog)
